## Concept
*  Concept start: Using natural language guidance to capture a screenshot from a video, example:  just type "shot in 23 seconds", then the editor will get a related shot of the video

*  Concept end: Completely replace ffmpeg functionality

*  Construction process: Utilize AI such as DeepSeek to simultaneously build a service program (replacing ffmpeg), one backend, and one frontend
